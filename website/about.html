                    <h2>Medicine Hat Alberta<br>By Sierra Hill<br><br>
                        Sierra Hill had always hated racist Medicine Hat Alberta with its modern,many mountains. 
                        It was a place where she felt sad. She was a stinky, smelly, soda drinker with pretty hands 
                        and small ears. Her friends saw her as a disturbed, dizzy devil. Once, she had even revived a 
                        dying duck. That's the sort of girl she was. Sierra walked over to the window and reflected 
                        on her stinky surroundings. The smelly teased like crawling cats. Then she saw something in 
                        the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Lauren Hill. Lauren was a dumb brute 
                        with stinky hands and smelly ears. Sierra gulped. She was not prepared for Lauren. As Sierra 
                        stepped outside and Lauren came closer, she could see the lonely glint in her eye. Lauren 
                        glared with all the wrath of 3480 stupid curious cows. She said, in hushed tones, "I hate you 
                        and I want a cookie." Sierra looked back, even more giggly and still fingering the sexy apple. 
                        "Lauren, you smell," she replied. They looked at each other with angry feelings, like two breezy, 
                        broad birds screaming at a very idiotic Thomas's funeral, which had punk rock music playing 
                        in the background and two dumbass uncles dying to the beat. Suddenly, Lauren lunged forward 
                        and tried to punch Sierra in the face. Quickly, Sierra grabbed the sexy apple and brought 
                        it down on Lauren's skull. Lauren's stinky hands trembled and her smelly ears wobbled. 
                        She looked furious, her emotions raw like a chilly, cuddly cookie. Then she let out an 
                        agonising groan and collapsed onto the ground. Moments later Lauren Hill was dead. 
                        Sierra Hill went back inside and made herself a nice drink of soda.<br><br>                   
                        THE END
